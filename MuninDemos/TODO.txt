TODO - MUNIN DEMOS
Niklas Elmqvist - June 1, 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Demos to implement:
[X] Application launchpad (for launching demos across multiple machines)?
[X] Image stitch (event-driven)
[X] Mouse stitch (event-driven) 
[X] Tetris game (real-time simulation component)
[X] Multidimensional visualization
[X] Video player (external and internal events)
[ ] Vector drawing (event-driven)


General issues:
[X] Toggle fullscreen and windowed mode for all demos
[X] Create a demo-wide property file with the java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true property
[X] Do we need to maintain a shared geometry list in order to accommodate different-sized windows?
[X] For a shared object to be usable as an event, we need to be able to build content before creating it
[X] Combine all of the demos into the same shared space (same as the launchpad)?
[ ] Manage logging so that it makes sense (save the logs?)
[ ] Persistent store of shared space?


Application launchpad: (outside the scope of this project?)
[ ] Support discovery of devices (connect to the launchpad detector?)
[ ] App families, maintains app layout and which apps are compatible
[ ] Store default configuration and startup surface in property file
[ ] Create script or executable for restarting and updating launchpad
[ ] Launchpad application has a suitable icon
[ ] Support for run configurations that map machines to surfaces and apps/services 
[ ] List of run configurations in user interface
[X] Geometry management
[N] Force the launchpad to run as a single instance per host? (solve by listening to a localhost port)
[X] All Munin applications are apps (should now be services?)
[X] Contains information about physical configuration of devices
[X] List of connected launchpads
[X] List of all connected peers
[N] Launchpads can run in master or slave mode (toggle with a UI checkbox or button?)
[X] Allow for shutdown of all launchpads 
[X] List of plugins
[X] List of space configurations


Visualization example: 
[X] Multidimensional visualization


Image stitch - spread large images over multiple peers:
[X] Handle viewport resize
[X] Support fullscreen for this demo
[X] Fix the calculation of tiles depending on size
[~] Fix the horizontal size bug (due to differing viewport sizes)
[X] Resetting view (set offsets to zero)
[X] Allow for zooming


Vector editor - allow for editing vector figures across multiple instances:
[ ] Correct depth order
[ ] Support multiple types of vectors 
[ ] Viewport management and navigation


Tetris game - play Tetris across several screens (separate render and control):
[ ] Implement Android controller


Video player - play video across several screens (maybe use VLC and VLCJ - http://www.capricasoftware.co.uk/vlcj/)
[X] Eli Fisher's project
[X] Export a byte buffer from a master instance
[X] Synchronize merely a stream from multiple instances (YouTube etc)
